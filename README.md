## About Karma

Karma is a revolutionary AI application designed to simplify and supercharge your interactions with artificial intelligence. It goes beyond simple chatbot interfaces by orchestrating multiple AI models, understanding your unique needs, and even creating autonomous AI agents to tackle complex tasks on your behalf. Karma ensures that you get the most out of AI, without needing to be an expert in prompt engineering or workflow design.

## Vision

To make the vast potential of artificial intelligence universally accessible and effortlessly powerful, transforming complex tasks into intuitive experiences tailored just for you.

## Key Features

* **Multi-AI Model Selection:** Directly choose from a curated library of various AI models for text generation, image creation, data analysis, and more, all within a unified interface.
* **Smart Prompt Enhancement:** An intelligent layer that automatically analyzes your input, clarifies ambiguities, adds necessary context, and rephrases your prompt for the best possible AI understanding and output.
* **Personalized Experience Engine:** An integrated machine learning system that adapts to your behavior, preferences, and recurring needs, offering tailored suggestions and optimizing workflows specifically for you.
* **Dynamic AI Agent Creation:** Define a high-level goal, and the app will autonomously design, deploy, and manage a series of interconnected AI sub-tasks and agents to execute the entire workflow.
* **Seamless Context Management (MCP):** Ensures that the "memory" and vital information from one AI interaction or step are seamlessly passed to the next, maintaining coherence and enabling complex, continuous projects without losing track.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1.  **User Input:** You provide a prompt or a complex task to Karma.
2.  **Smart Prompting:** Karma's internal ML analyzes your input, identifies any ambiguities or missing details, and uses a powerful language model to generate an optimized, clear, and complete prompt.
3.  **Model Selection / Agent Creation:** Based on your refined prompt and learned preferences, Karma either selects the most suitable individual AI model or, for complex tasks, dynamically designs and initiates a multi-step AI agent.
4.  **Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Action:** As the task progresses, Karma utilizes its internal Model Context Protocol to ensure that the output and context from one AI model or agent step are seamlessly and coherently passed as input to the next.
5.  **AI Execution:** The chosen AI models or orchestrated agents perform their designated tasks.
6.  **Result Delivery:** Karma presents the final, refined output to you.

## Technical Stack

Karma is built with a modern, scalable web stack:

* **Frontend:**
    * React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    * Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
    * Lucide React: For clean, customizable icons.
* **AI Integration:**
    * Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash`): For intelligent prompt enhancement and primary text-based AI responses.
    * Google Imagen API (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`): (Conceptual for image generation, placeholder in current MVP).
* **State Management / Local Persistence (MVP):**
    * React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
    * `localStorage`: For basic client-side preference persistence.
* **Conceptual Backend (for future development):**
    * Python with FastAPI: For robust API services, task orchestration, and ML logic.
    * Firestore: For scalable cloud-based data persistence (user data, conversation history, agent definitions).
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
    * Custom in-app implementation for managing and transferring context between AI interactions.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Karma up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/karma.git](https://github.com/your-username/karma.git)
cd karma

Installation
Install the necessary Node.js packages:
npm install
# or
yarn install

Running the App
To start the development server:
npm start
# or
yarn start

This will open the app in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
API Key Configuration
For the current MVP, the AI API calls are configured to work within the Google Canvas environment, where API keys are automatically provided at runtime.
In the src/App.js file, you will find const apiKey = "";. Do not modify this line if you are running the app within a Canvas environment. If you were to deploy this outside of Canvas and use your own Google Cloud project, you would typically manage API keys via environment variables (e.g., .env file) and a backend proxy.
